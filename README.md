# CSS Complexity Analyzer

Based on the article [Cyclomatic Complexity in CSS](https://blog.frankmtaylor.com/2023/10/26/cyclomatic-complexity-in-css/), this is a tool that calculates the complexity of rulesets and stylesheets.

## Pre-requisites

* Node 18+
* NPM 9+

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

TBD.


This will probably be developed to work both as a CLI and possibly to integrate into something like postcss & friends. Step 1 is to make this a CLI, though.

## Contributing

As of right now the source files are being developed. Make sure any classes in `src` have corresponding tests in `test`.

Yeah see the contributing doc. This could use smart people.
